  year: 2015
  description:  This label is awarded by the CPU (Conférence des Présidents d’Universités), GENCI, and the Maison de la Simulation, to doctors who demonstrated skills related to high performance computing during their PhD. The C3I label is multidisciplinary, and covers all domains of science, from theory to applied research. The candidate must have shown evidence of skills related to the use and application of HPC (optimization of parallel codes, distributed and parallel algorithms, large scale data management…). The label is awarded as a mean to increase the visibility of the work conducted by these young doctors, and provides them with an additional asset in their career, whether this career evolves in the academic sector or in the industry.
