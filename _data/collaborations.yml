  - name: "Mochi: a Software Defined Storage Approach to Exascale Storage Services"
    duration: 2015 - Present
    partners: ANL, LANL, CMU, HDF Group
    description: DOE-funded project working on designing efficient building blocks for data services in HPC systems. In this context I am the lead on multiple libraries for storage, I/O, and networking.

  - name: Data@Exascale associated team
    duration: 2013 - 2018
    partners: KerData (Inria Rennes, IRISA), ANL, UIUC
    description: The team addresses the area of large scale data management for post-petascale supercomputers and for clouds. We aim to investigate several open issues related to storage and I/O in HPC, but also in situ data visualization and analysis from large scale simulations.
